# details regarding project

project is based on Next.js
Hooks of React JS are used
For styling I have used Tailwing.css
For testing I have use jest
Navigation is implemented using Link in Next.js

I haven't applied any extra ordinary designing, since the time alloted was less plus I focused on the coding and testing part which I think were High level requirements. I have make sure to showcase my skills by incorporating as many functionalities as I could, keeping in view thw timing constraint.
